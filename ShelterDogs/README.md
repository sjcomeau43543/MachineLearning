# Shelter Dog Classifier

## Motivation
Shelters cannot with confidence label dogs as being a certain breed because, ultimately, it is a guessing game. With a classifier, hopefully shelters will be able to easily label dogs with their breed and confidence score which will hopefully give the shelter more credibility and the dog a higher opportunity to be adopted.

## Background
The dataset used is the Standford Dogs Dataset found at [Stanford's Vision Site](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). This dataset was extracted from the ImageNet dataset.
